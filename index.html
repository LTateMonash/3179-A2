  <h1>Australian States</h1>

                <h2>Population</h2>
                <p>As seen here, the population varies heavily between the states in Australia. Based on the topographical map, New South Wales and Victoria are the two most populated states in Australia.
                It seem like the population of Australia is more Eastern-centric, which makes sense due to the less harsh climate and proximity to the ocean, which is not as prevalent in states like 
                Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="graph" id="chart1"></div>

        <div class="content right">
            <div class="text-box">
                <h2>Housing Prices</h2>
                <p>The housing prices also vary heavily between the states. The states with the larger populations, New South Wales and Victoria, have expectedly high housing prices. However, an anomaly here is ACT. 
                It has a population much less than the other states, but housing prices that compare to those of states with populations of 6-8M. This is likely due to the finite amount of land available in the small state.</p>

                <h2>Land Value, Protected Land and Population</h2>
                <p>This is a chart that compares the total building value against the percentage of protected land in the state, with the bubble representing the size of the population. We can see that NSW and VIC have the 
                highest building value, but the least amount of protected land. A slight trend that is seen is that % of protected land increases as the population of the state reduces, which makes sense as these
                are likely smaller states. ACT has a near 56% of protected land, making it easily the state with the most protected land in Australia. This is likely due to its national parks and proximity to the bush.</p>

            <div class="text-box">
                <h2>Median Income</h2>
                <p>The median income for each state refers to the middle value of the incomes of all working individuals in the state, once organised into ascending order. Most of the states have very similar median incomes, 
                with all showing signs of increasing over time, likely due to inflation and pricing pressures. ACT has the highest median wage, which makes sense since a large proportion of people there are working in politics,
                which is very lucrative.</p>

                <h2>Industry</h2>
                <p>The following chart compares the number of jobs that exist in each of the industries in each state. Mining is particulary of interest here, as states like WA, NSW and VIC all have large mining operations.
                Industries like Electricity and Real Estate are very small in comparison, which can be attributed to the smaller scale of these businesses.</p>
